    <h1>Figured i would make a little practice area to level up my skills</h1>

    <p> What I could is a little Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Iure, perferendis? But that's
        too easy, to you know, fill the space? I need to figure out how to wrap in vscode.
        Becuase this whole writting outside of the margins thing is starting to get a bit annyoing.
        I Don't know what im going to include in this litle project of mine, but what I will be sure to do it update it
        with whatever I may learn. You know to stay fresh and ensure I internalize all the new info.</p>
    <p>While reviewing the homeroom section of the flatiron school, they brought up something that could help me lang a
        job or at least let prospective employeers know that i'm still learning new things.
        They mentioned that i should create a blog or vlog. Somewhere as they said, "communicate that you're still
        learning, and build on your online presence". I think maybe i could tie this little project into that somehow.
